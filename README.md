## Getting started

* Go to http://aloha-wikidocs.com/ and get an API key.
* Create a file called credentials.php in this directory with the
following content, replacing INSERT_* with the corresponding values of
your API key.

        <?php
        define("APP_ID", "INSERT_APP_ID_HERE");
        define("APP_SECRET", "INSERT_APP_SECRET_HERE");
	?>
